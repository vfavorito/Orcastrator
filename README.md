## Overview:
This app allows a user to create new pods(groups) and send invites to fellow orcas(users) to join your created pod! While in a pod you are in an active chat room with anyone else in the same pod!  This was primarily accomplished using React, Express, node.js, and Socket.io.

Once you enter the app you will need to either sign in with github or google or create a local account and sign in with those credentials.  Then Create a pod by clicking the create a pod button and fill out the info.  Lastly add orcas to your pod by first selecting the pod then clicking the add an orca button.  Enter the username of the orca you would like to invite and hit invite.  On the recieving end of an invite you will need to accept the invite request before being placed in the pod.
